		<p class="col2"><font color=#AFB983><strong>Edgar Allen Poe</font></strong> <font color=#DACFCC>he was inspired by poverty, and his harsh upbringing to lead the success of his bleak stories and poems.<br> He never specifically liked any books (he used to be a reviewer that he was known for his harsh criticism )<br> but he was thrilled about Charles Dickens it could be about their similar upbringing that could have similar stories to enjoy. <br>My favourite was an exceptionally famous poem <i>The Raven</i> it a story that scares you bute not from ghost, not a monster, but it's a sad truth, realism.</p>

			<font color=#AFB983><strong>Robert Frost</strong></font>
			he was inspired by other poets Edward Thomas, Rupert Brooke, and Robert 
Graves. <br>Another poet who helped him publish and promote Ezra. He always loves writing. One of his favourites really surprised me "The Jungle Book, ” by Rudyard Kipling.<br> His work was interesting as it talks about the realistic depiction of people in rural life and compares to urban life he talks about nature, communication, lifestyles etc.<br> My favourite work was <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i> it's short but explain greed for riches and some say described <br>as a sin as it talks about Eden well known for Adam and Eve the Eden garden</p>

		<p class="col2"><font color=#AFB983><strong>Walt Whitman</strong> </font>was inspired by a lot of different things one was his travels in America inspired a work called leaves of grass.<br> He loved nature, American democracy and individualism. <br>His poems inspired and change the whole thing of poetry as he uses forbidden or unusual topics <br>and what people who still don't talk about in the present day like sexuality.<br> His favourite author was Ralph Waldo Emerson admiration also lead to Leaves of grass. <br>My favourite poem was <i>Song to Myself</i> where my moral of the story is its important to love yourself.<br>In that time where critics were disturb about his writing ,making harsh burst of comentary (he was very disliked before his death).</p>

		<h1 class="col">How does the poem in the short story,<br> “there will come soft rains” by Sara Teasdale<br> play a crucial role in the story by Ray Bradbury?<br> and why?</h1>
		<p class="col2">
This art of literacy have a similar idea or plot talking about mankind destructive ways <br>exterminate themselves by there own machinery another link was it was made due to the unfortunate event of WW2.<br> The poem talks about radiation sickness and how it affects us but also the surroundings.<br> The story talks about the dangers of nuclear warfare and how we advance technology to our frightening ways to abuse it.<br>These help to reinforce the idea by both different styles or form of literature <br>some purposed that it could be a warning for the next generation.
